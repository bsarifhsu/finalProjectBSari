## Description
Cyber+ App utilizes [NetDetective API](https://rapidapi.com/tomwimmenhove/api/netdetective) which is an easy-to-use API that provides information about an IP address, including, but not limited to, whether itâ€™s known for spam, brute-force attacks, bot-nets, VPN endpoints, data center endpoints, and more.
